# Angular-Project-Defense-SoftUni-

The src code of my first Angular project at SoftUni, which I will have to defend a few days from its creation... 

The project will be about workout programs. A logged in user will be able to 'buy' a program and/or hire a personal online coach (trainer) and will be able to see the programs he owns and some extra details + read reviews of other users.
